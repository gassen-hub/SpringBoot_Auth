Email Verification: Sends verification emails to users during registration to confirm their accounts.
MySQL Database: Stores and manages user data efficiently with MySQL.
RESTful API: Easily integrates with frontend applications or other services.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Java-based framework for building the API.
JWT: For secure token-based authentication.
MySQL: Relational database for storing user information.
Postman: API testing and validation during development.
